# Multi-Dimensional-Tic-Tac-Toe

Small fangame I made based on the web novel "Everybody Loves Large Chests" - A web novel about the misadventures of a powerful mimic.

In this game, you try to line up a tic-tac-toe across three cubes (or using one cube), using the win-conditions and rules listed here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o3TDQMW-erLn1ZjVDHjxlV7Nkl6ikGxoHUVt6c16MdE/edit?usp=sharing

In summary, you take turns with your opponent (either local or online), and select one square out of each the three rubix cube like objects in front of you. They light up when there is a move remaining on a cube. When you moved once on all three cubes, it goes to your opponent who does the same. Every six rounds, you and your opponenet rotate one face of the cube. The game continues until a tie is reached, or someone achieves one of 8 win conditions. 

Music and graphics can be selected in the home screen (only two options at the moment). 

Will be adding a youtube demo shortly.
